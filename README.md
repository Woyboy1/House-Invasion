# House-Invasion

This repo contains the source code to my game, House Invasion on 

itch.io: https://woyboy.itch.io/house-invasion 

This code is very janky and rushed because this was planned to be a rushed 3 day project. But it ended up taking long with the reoccuring Netcode errors. This project was made with Unity's multiplayer frameowrk, Netcode for GameObjects (NGO). This was also considered a "practice" project for Netcode, which I will use referenced code for "Gash"
